# Basement Doors Program
### Using an API Key for Tomorrow.io, I parse the json weather data and unmarshall it into a weather struct. The program is designed to run indefinitely with calls to the API every 30 minutes to check for precipitation probability. If the probability is 50% or greater, I get an email notifying me to close the basement doors.
